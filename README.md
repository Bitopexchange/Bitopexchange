2.2 Bitop brings trading experience to the next level
Compared with decentralized exchanges, centralized exchanges have a much better trading experience and higher efficiency. 

In addition, the advantages of centralized cryptocurrency trading include:

1.User friendly ‚Äî Provide efficient matching system for transactions
Bitop exchange provides beginners with familiar and user-friendly trading tools. In contrast to the use of complex encrypted wallets and peer-to-peer transactions in decentralized exchanges, users of decentralized exchanges must remember the keys and passwords of their encrypted wallets, otherwise, their assets will be lost forever and cannot be recovered.

2. Convenience- Superior user experience
Why are decentralized exchanges with high security still not popular among traders? The fundamental reason here is that due to technical immaturity and limitations, decentralized exchange lack in liquidity, trading pairs, transaction speed, and user experience is incomparable to commonly used centralized exchanges (such as Binance, Huobi, Okex etc.).

Bitop exchange constantly focuses on development and innovation to provide convenient user and have a balance between ease of use, convenience and security performance.

3. Liquidity-Quickly match transaction orders
Due to the high transaction volume and liquidity of centralized exchanges, it is very easy to match transaction orders, all within a few seconds. However, decentralized transactions often lack liquidity due to insufficient transaction volume. When the transaction volume is low, it is difficult for users to execute transaction orders. As a result, users may have to wait several hours or days to buy/sell their own transaction orders.
Bitop will continue to develop its own products, providing an advanced and secure digital asset trading platform with the fastest transactions speed, and will have many more convenient payment methods.

2.5 Bitop business products
Throughout the entire CFD trading market, the major contract trading platforms have extremely limited trading tools, and insufficient trading volume, spreads, depth, trading strategies, etc. If an individual wants to obtain a trading income from these exchanges, one can imagine how difficult it is. On the other hand, Bitop trading platform does not have the above-mentioned problems, which will maximize users profits greatly in the long term.

Bitop's trading products are mainly divided into four typesÔºö

Spot trading 
Currently, most people are doing spot trading. Which is to buy and own an underlying digital asset and wait for the price to increase to take profit. This is still a speculative behavior in the traditional sense, like the nature of buying and selling stocks. Spot trading is the most recognized one of the most primitive investment methods by retail investors in the market to earn profits.
Spot Trading: If user A invests 200,000 yuan (cost) to buy Bitcoin, the purchase price is 2,000 yuan, and the spot can buy 100 BTC. If it rises to 3,000 yuan, the profit will be 100,000. Profit rate: (100,000/200,000)*100%=50%.

Margin trading 
Leveraged trading is a supplement tool for spot trading. Users use their funds as a margin and borrow N times the margin from the platform as the principal for investment. Therefore, leverage is also called a margin trading system. In this process, users need to make repayments based on the amount of borrowed money, interest rate, and time. The calculation method is simple interest.

Leveraged trading will also be accompanied by the concept of leverage multiples. The 10 times leverage we often say is to magnify your funds by 10 times to earn income. The higher the leverage, the higher the profit. In contrast, the risks that need to be taken are correspondingly higher.

CFD trading
Through CFD trading, you can go long or short the price of Bitcoin, find profit opportunities from rising or falling trends, and you can also use leverage. CFDs only trade whether the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall relative to the U.S. dollar, and therefore will not hold Bitcoin. If you trade in the correct direction, you will profit; if you trade in the wrong direction, you will lose money.

On our exchange, you can log in to an existing account or create a new account now to start trading Bitcoin CFDs. You can also choose to open a demo account for practice trading before starting real trading.

Perpetual contract 
A perpetual contract is a kind of derivatives similar to leveraged spot trading and is a digital currency contract product settled in digital currencies such as BTC and USDT.

Investors can get the benefits of rising digital currency prices by buying and going long, or they can get the benefits of falling digital currency prices by selling and shorting. There is a certain difference between a perpetual contract and traditional futures: it has no expiration time, so there is no restriction on the holding time.

On the whole, Bitop Exchange is a platform that is very suitable for new users to operate. It creates an excellent trading project from all angles, allowing digital currency enthusiasts around the world to participate in digital asset transactions and enjoy the benefits of it.
